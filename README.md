## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I had a hard time trying to style the page to the way I like it to since my CSS code sometimes overlap with each other. This makes other style invalid. I had to go back to check which part of the code is causing the problem.
- I also had a hard time trying to make the page responsive. I use React Bootstrap, but it is still not perfect. For example, in the last row. there a gap between the two cards. I played around with different ways to fix the problem, but I still can't find a way to fix it.
